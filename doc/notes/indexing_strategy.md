# LMDB Store design for RDFLib

This is a log of subsequent strategies employed to store triples in LMDB.

Strategy #5a is the one currently used. The rest is kept for historic reasons
and academic curiosity (and also because it was too much work to just wipe out
of memory).

## Storage approach

- Pickle quad and create MD5 or SHA1 hash.
- Store triples in one database paired with key; store indices separately.

Different strategies involve layout and number of databases.

## Strategy #1

- kq: key: serialized triple (1:1)
- sk: Serialized subject: key (1:m)
- pk: Serialized predicate: key (1:m)
- ok: Serialized object: key (1:m)
- (optional) lok: Serialized literal object: key (1:m)
- (optional) tok: Serialized RDF type: key (1:m)
- ck: Serialized context: key (1:m)

### Retrieval approach

To find all matches for a quad:

- If all terms in the quad are bound, generate the key from the pickled
quad and look up the triple in `kt`
- If all terms are unbound, return an iterator of all values in `kt`.
- If some values are bound and some unbound (most common query):
  - Get a base list of keys associated wirh the first bound term
  - For each subsequent bound term, check if each key associated with the term
  matches a key in the base list
  - Continue through all the bound terms. If a match is not found at any point,
  continue to the next term
  - If a match is found in all the bound term databases, look up the pickled quad
  matching the key in `kq` and yield it

More optimization can be introduced later, e.g. separating literal and RDF
type objects in separate databases. Literals can have very long values and a
database with a longer key setting may be useful. RDF terms can be indexed
separately because they are the most common bound term.

### Example lookup

Keys and Triples (should actually be quads but this is a simplified version):

A: s1 p1 o1
B: s1 p2 o2
C: s2 p3 o1
D: s2 p3 o3

Indices:

- SK:
  - s1: A, B
  - s2: C, D
- PK:
  - p1: A
  - p2: B
  - p3: C, D
 - OK:
  - o1: A, C
  - o2: B
  - o3: D

Queries:

- s1 ?p ?o → {A, B}
- s1 p2 ?o → {A, B} & {B} = {B}
- ?s ?p o3 → {D}
- s1 p2 o5 → {} (Exit at OK: no term matches 'o5')
- s2 p3 o2 → {C, D} & {C, D} & {B} = {}


## Strategy #2

Separate data and indices in two environments.

### Main data store

Key to quad; main keyspace; all unique.

### Indices

None of these databases is of critical preservation concern. They can be
rebuilt from the main data store.

All dupsort and dupfixed.

@TODO The first three may not be needed if computing term hash is fast enough.

- t2k (term to term key)
- lt2k (literal to term key: longer keys)
- k2t (term key to term)

- s2k (subject key to quad key)
- p2k (pred key to quad key)
- o2k (object key to quad key)
- c2k (context key to quad key)

- sc2qk (subject + context keys to quad key)
- po2qk (predicate + object keys to quad key)

- sp2qk (subject + predicate keys to quad key)
- oc2qk (object + context keys to quad key)

- so2qk (subject + object keys to quad key)
- pc2qk (predicate + context keys to quad key)


## Strategy #3

Contexts are much fewer (even in graph per aspect, 5-10 triples per graph)

### Main data store

Preservation-worthy data

- tk:t (triple key: triple; dupsort, dupfixed)
- tk:c (context key: triple; unique)

### Indices

Rebuildable from main data store

- s2k (subject key: triple key)
- p2k (pred key: triple key)
- o2k (object key: triple key)
- sp2k
- so2k
- po2k
- spo2k

### Lookup

1. Look up triples by s, p, o, sp, so, po and get keys
2. If a context is specified, for each key try to seek to (context, key) in ct
   to verify it exists
3. Intersect sets
4. Match triple keys with data using kt

#### Shortcuts

- Get all contexts: return list of keys from ct
- Get all triples for a context: get all values for a contex from ct and match
  triple data with kt
- Get one triple match for all contexts: look up in triple indices and match
  triple data with kt


## Strategy #4

Terms are entered individually in main data store. Also, shorter keys are
used rather than hashes. These two aspects save a great deal of space and I/O,
but require an additional index to put the terms together in a triple.

### Main Data Store

- t:st (term key: serialized term; 1:1)
- spo:c (joined S, P, O keys: context key; 1:m)
- c: (context keys only, values are the empty bytestring)

Storage total: variable

### Indices

- th:t (term hash: term key; 1:1)
- c:spo (context key: joined triple keys; 1:m)
- s:po (S key: P + O key; 1:m)
- p:so (P key: S + O keys; 1:m)
- o:sp (object key: triple key; 1:m)
- sp:o (S + P keys: O key; 1:m)
- so:p (S + O keys: P key; 1:m)
- po:s (P + O keys: S key; 1:m)

Storage total: 143 bytes per triple

### Disadvantages

- Lots of indices
- Terms can get orphaned:
  - No easy way to know if a term is used anywhere in a quad
  - Needs some routine cleanup
  - On the other hand, terms are relatively light-weight and can be reused
  - Almost surely not reusable are UUIDs, message digests, timestamps etc.


## Strategy #5

Reduce number of indices and rely on parsing and splitting keys to find triples
with two bound parameters.

This is especially important for keeping indexing synchronous to achieve fully
ACID writes.

### Main data store

Same as Strategy #4:

- t:st (term key: serialized term; 1:1)
- spo:c (joined S, P, O keys: context key; dupsort, dupfixed)
- c: (context keys only, values are the empty bytestring; 1:1)

Storage total: variable (same as #4)

### Indices

- th:t (term hash: term key; 1:1)
- s:po (S key: joined P, O keys; dupsort, dupfixed)
- p:so (P key: joined S, O keys; dupsort, dupfixed)
- o:sp (O key: joined S, P keys; dupsort, dupfixed)
- c:spo (context → triple association; dupsort, dupfixed)

Storage total: 95 bytes per triple

### Lookup strategy

- ? ? ? c: [c:spo] all SPO for C → split key → [t:st] term from term key
- s p o c: [c:spo] exact SPO & C match → split key → [t:st] term from term key
- s ? ?: [s:po] All PO for S → split key → [t:st] term from term key
- s p ?: [s:po] All PO for S → filter result by P in split key
    → [t:st] term from term key

### Advantages

- Less indices: smaller index size and less I/O

### Disadvantages

- Possibly slower retrieval for queries with 2 bound terms (run metrics)

### Further optimization

In order to minimize traversing and splittig results, the first retrieval
should be made on the term with less average keys. Search order can be balanced
by establishing a lookup order for indices.

This can be achieved by calling stats on the index databases and looking up the
database with *most* keys. Since there is an equal number of entries in each of
the (s:po, p:so, o:sp) indices, the one with most keys will have the least
average number of values per key. If that lookup is done first, the initial
data set to traverse and filter will be smaller.


## Strategy #5a

This is a slightly different implementation of #5 that somewhat simplifies and
perhaps speeds up things a bit. It is the currently employed solution.

The indexing and lookup strtegy is the same; but instead of using a separator
byte for splitting compound keys, the logic relies on the fact that keys have
a fixed length and are sliced instead. This *should* result in faster key
manipulation, also because in most cases `memoryview` buffers can be used
directly instead of being copied from memory.

Index storage is 90 bytes per triple.
