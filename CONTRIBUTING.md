# Contribution Guidelines

Let's keep it short.

- Constructive contributions of all kinds are very welcome. 
- Unless an issue is trivial and obvious, please open an issue before starting a PR. 
- Please submit PRs to the "development" branch unless it's a hotfix (to be coordinated with the repo admin(s))
