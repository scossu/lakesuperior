Contributing to LAKEsuperior
============================

LAKEsuperior has been so far a single personâ€™s off-hours project (with much
very valuable input from several sides). In order to turn into anything close
to a Beta release and eventually to a production-ready implementation, it
needs some community love.

Contributions are welcome in all forms, including ideas, issue reports,
or even just spinning up the software and providing some feedback.
LAKEsuperior is meant to live as a community project.

Development Setup
-----------------

To set up the software for developing code, documentation, or tests, follow the
:ref:`manual installation <manual_install>` instructions.

You can contribute by (from least to most involved):

- Installing the repository and reporting any issues
- Testing on other platforms (OS X, Windows, other Linux distros)
- Loading some real-world data set and sharing interesting results
- Amending incorrect documentation or adding missing one
- Adding test coverage (**HOT**)
- Browsing the list of open issues and picking a ticket that you may find
  interesting and within your reach
- Suggesting new functionality or improvements and/or implementing them

Please open a ticket and discuss the issue you are raising before opening a PR.

Development is done on the development branch. If you have any suggested

and open a pull request against development. In case you find a critical bug,
a hotfix can be proposed against master if agreed in the related issue
discussion.
