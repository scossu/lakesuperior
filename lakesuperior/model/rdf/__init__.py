Model for RDF entities: Term, Triple, Graph.

Members of this package are the core building blocks of the Lakesuperior RDF
model. They are C extensions mostly used in higher layers of the application,
but some of them also have a public Python API to allow efficient manipulation
of large RDF datasets.

See individual modules for detailed documentation:

- :py:mod:`lakesuperior.model.rdf.term`
- :py:mod:`lakesuperior.model.rdf.triple`
- :py:mod:`lakesuperior.model.rdf.graph`
